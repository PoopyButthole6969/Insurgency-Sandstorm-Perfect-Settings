# Insurgency-Sandstorm-Perfect-Settings
Highest frame rate / per quality settings I've achieved through conglomeration of multiple sources.

The purpose of thee files [Engine.ini] and [GameUserSettings.ini] are to adjust the settings of Unreal Engine and the Game, respectively.
Assuming your hardware includes a GPU with at least 2gb of memory these settings should work flawlessly. 

The file path to apply these files should be C:\ Users \ [user profile] \ local \ appdata \ insurgency \ saved \ config \ WindowsClient
Copy and paste both of these files to this folder.

The other files in this repository are presets that I've come to like. My current favorite is [revised.ini]
Just download the latest ReShade, and follow the instructions to install all shaders available.
Then, copy and paste the three .ini files into the root folder of Sandstorm.
For me it's C:\\--\ steam \ steamapps \ common \ sandstorm
Then you can load the presets when you start the game and open the reshade menu. (For me the button to open is [Home])
